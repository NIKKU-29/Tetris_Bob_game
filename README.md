2. **Clarity:** Added a placeholder for the specific run command (step 3 of installation) to avoid ambiguity.
3. **Visual Appeal:** Adjusted emoji usage for balance—kept them fun but not overwhelming.
4. **Structure:** Tightened section titles (“Overview” instead of “About the Game”) and added subtle calls-to-action (“Join the Fun”).
5. **Professional Polish:** Linked the MIT License and refined wording for a GitHub audience.
