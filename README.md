### Key Improvements:
1. **Tone & Flow:** Made it punchier and more engaging with concise phrasing (“Stack ‘Em Up” vs. “Move and Rotate blocks”).
2. **Clarity:** Added a placeholder for the specific run command (step 3 of installation) to avoid ambiguity.
3. **Visual Appeal:** Adjusted emoji usage for balance—kept them fun but not overwhelming.
4. **Structure:** Tightened section titles (“Overview” instead of “About the Game”) and added subtle calls-to-action (“Join the Fun”).
5. **Professional Polish:** Linked the MIT License and refined wording for a GitHub audience.

Feel free to tweak the placeholder parts (like the run command or screenshot path) to match your project! What do you think—any specific vibe or details you’d like to emphasize further?
